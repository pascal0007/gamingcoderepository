I will be uploading code from an open source book. All rules apply to using
code from open source projects. Some will be back on CSS/HTML5/JavaScript.
The other games will be based on gui with Python 3 code. Maintenance of
said code is not my responsibility. You make changes you are responsible
for how the code works. I do not want to hear/read about need for
assistance!
